# the-frugal-ham

Hello all radio-interested Humanoids:

I have here a website about ham radio on a budget, as well as a Website about my journey through ham radio, As a beginner with absolutely no experience and no money I figured it would be fun to keep track of my progress through this website. Which reminds me; Thank you Redditer MonkeyPanls, for the idea that this website is based on.
